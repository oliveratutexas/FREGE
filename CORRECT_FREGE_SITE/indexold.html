FREGE (Fundamentals of Reasoning for the Electronic Age) is a pair of introductory "courses":
<ul>
<li>
Reasoning (Logic)
<li>
Discrete Mathematics (Sets, Relations and Functions)
</ul>

FREGE's target audience is beginning computer science students, but the Reasoning course is also appropriate for students in other disciplines who want to learn the art of clear thinking.
<p>
Course materials include:
<ul>
<li>An online "book", i.e., a collection of slides that present all the course material.  No supplementary book is required.
<li>A large collection of problems that are integrated into the slides.  These courses are sandboxes.  Students don't just read; they practice and experiment continuously.
<li>A collection of short videos.
<li>A collection of plugin apps that enable students to explore specific topics in a highly interactive way.  See the menu at the left for links to those that can be accessed as standalone environments.
<p>
</ul>
The current implementation of these courses uses the <a href="https://quest.cns.utexas.edu/">Quest</a> platform, designed and hosted at The University of Texas at Austin.  Interactive proof construction and evaluation are provided by Querium.
