<!-- Needs...

    A title of some sort
    A list of games that are available
    A list of the categories of games

    So, now....I just need the users to...make two repositories....
            one for the modifications that they make to 

    They just have to go into the Games.yaml folder and modify that with their game description....I can just add a script to find
    their descriptions and concatenate them. That is

        for each stuff in repo:
            concatenate stuff.description onto games.yaml
            move stuff into x.
