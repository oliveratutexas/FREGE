<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'>During the Gulf War in the early 1990’s<span style='"Courier New"'>, 
  Operation Desert Storm used </span><span style='"Courier New"'>sophisticated 
  technology to end the war in a quick and timely manner. Part of this technology 
  was that of the Patriot missile air defence system.<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>On the night of the 25<sup>th</sup> of February, 
  1991, a Patriot missile system operating in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, failed to 
  track and intercept an incoming Scud. The Iraqi missile impacted into an army 
  barracks, killing 28 U.S. soldiers and injuring another 98. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The cause of the missile system failing to defend 
  against the incoming Scud was traced back to a bug in Patriot’s radar and tracking 
  software.<sup>2</sup></p>
<h3>Background Information</h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The Patriot is a surface-to-air defence missile 
  system manufactured by Raytheon<sup>3</sup> and used by the United States 
  Army, originally designed to protect against Soviet cruise missiles and medium 
  to high altitude aircraft. In order to avoid detection it was mobile and would 
  only operate for a few hours at a time.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>During Operation Desert Shield (the operation to 
  move forces to the Gulf region), Patriot battalions were deployed in strategic 
  locations in Saudi Arabia and Israel to defend key assets, military personnel, 
  and citizens against Scud missiles launched by Iraqi forces.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Each battalion usually comprised of six batteries, 
  with each battery containing a number of components including a single ground 
  based radar unit used for surveillance target detection and tracking, an Engagement 
  Control Station to control missile interceptors, eight missile launchers, as 
  well as various communications and relay components.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The Patriot’s weapon control computer performs crucial 
  system functions for tracking and intercepting targets, as well as other control 
  tasks. The system tracked and intercepted missiles in a number of stages:</p>
<ol start=1 type=1>
  <li style='text-align:justify;     '>The system was instructed to search for 
    airborne objects with Scud missile characteristics (based on information such 
    as velocity, latitude, longitude, azimuth, and altitude) on its radar.</li>
  <li style='text-align:justify;     '>A range gate, an electronic device in the 
    radar, calculates an area in the air space for where the system should look 
    next for the incoming missile. The missile is tracked by the system as it 
    approaches.</li>
  <li style='text-align:justify;     '>The Patriot would launch one of it’s own 
    missiles once the incoming missile was in range.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Software Bug</h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The bug occurs in the calculation of the next location 
  of the incoming target by the range gate. The prediction is calculated based 
  on the target’s velocity and the time of the last radar detection. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Velocity is stored as a whole number and a decimal, 
  and time is a continuous integer or whole number (i.e. the longer the system 
  has been running, the larger the value) measured in tenths of a second.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The algorithm used to predict the next air space 
  to scan by the radar requires that both velocity and time be expressed as real 
  numbers. However, the Patriot’s computer only has 24 bit fixed-point registers. 
  Because time was measured as the number of tenth-seconds, the value 1/10, which 
  has a non-terminating binary expansion, was chopped at 24 bits after the radix 
  point.<sup>5</sup> The error in precision grows as the time value increases, 
  and the inaccuracy resulting from this is directly proportional to the target’s 
  velocity. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>When the Patriot system was first designed, the 
  primary targets were Soviet aircraft and cruise missiles travelling at speeds 
  around MACH 2, and only operating at a few hours at a time. However, in Operation 
  Desert Storm, they were deployed as static defences (operating continuously), 
  tracking and intercepting Scud missiles travelling at speeds of approximately 
  MACH 5.<sup>6</sup> Consequently, the U.S. army had to learn how to adapt 
  the Patriot for targets of much higher velocity.</p>
<h3>Discovery of the Bug</h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Ironically, Israeli forces had noticed the anomaly 
  in the Patriot’s range gate’s predictions in early February 1991, and informed 
  the U.S. Army of the problem. They told the Army that the Patriots suffered 
  a 20% targeting inaccuracy after continuous operation for 8 hours. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Army officials presumed that Patriot users were 
  not running the systems for longer than 8 hours at a time. They suggested if 
  they would be running for continuous periods, they were rebooted regularly (which 
  took around 1 minute and would reset the system clock to zero).</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The Army however did set to work to produce a fix 
  that would be distributed to all Patriot systems that would fix the problem.</p>
<h3>Consequences of the Bug</h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'>On the 25th February 1991, Iraqi forces targeting 
  an airfield in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia launched a Scud missile. Six Patriot batteries 
  were assigned to protect the airfields and seaports of Dhahran; in particular, 
  Alpha battery was the one assigned the targeted airfield.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Alpha battery had been in continuous operation for 
  over 100 consecutive hours, and the resulting inaccuracy resulting from the 
  software bug was roughly 0.34 seconds. However, this meant that the range gate 
  could not successfully track the incoming Scud (travelling at roughly 1.7km/sec, 
  so the time difference resulted in the range gate scanning an area of air space 
  more than half a kilometre away from the missile). See Appendix A and for more 
  details.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>No Patriot missiles were launched to intercept the 
  incoming Scud, which successfully hit a warehouse being used by the U.S. Army 
  as a barracks, killing 28 soldiers, and another 98 people were injured.</p>
<h3>The Bug Fix and Aftermath</h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'>When Patriot systems were brought into the Gulf 
  conflict, the software was modified (several times) to cope with the high speed 
  of ballistic missiles, for which the system was not originally designed.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The modification to fix this bug was to introduce 
  call subroutine that would do a more accurate integer to real conversion of 
  the time value. This subroutine was inserted roughly half a dozen times in various 
  locations in the Patriot software.<sup>8</sup> </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The modified software was released on 16 February 
  1991, however did not reach Dhahran till the 26 February 1991, the day after 
  the incident occurred. According to Army officials, the delay was caused by 
  the time it took to arrange for transportation of the software to wartime locations.<sup>(4)</sup></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Various reviews and reports on Patriot missile performance 
  were conducted throughout the 1990’s, and the Dhahran incident shows the necessity 
  of well-documented requirements, software testing and correctness.</p>
