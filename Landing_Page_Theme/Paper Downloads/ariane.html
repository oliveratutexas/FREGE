Of all the careless lines of code recorded      in the annals of computer science, this one may stand as the most devastatingly      efficient. From interviews with rocketry experts and an analysis prepared      for the space agency, a clear path from an arithmetic error to total destruction      emerges.<BR>         To play the tape backward:<BR>         At 39 seconds after launch, as the rocket reached an altitude      of two and a half miles, a self-destruct mechanism finished off Ariane 5,      along with its payload of four expensive and uninsured scientific satellites.      Self-destruction was triggered automatically because aerodynamic forces were      ripping the boosters from the rocket.<BR>         This disintegration had begun an instant before, when the spacecraft      swerved off course under the pressure of the three powerful nozzles in its      boosters and main engine. The rocket was making an abrupt course correction      that was not needed, compensating for a wrong turn that had not taken      place.<BR>         Steering was controlled by the on-board computer, which mistakenly      thought the rocket needed a course change because of numbers coming from      the inertial guidance system. That device uses gyroscopes and accelerometers      to track motion. The numbers looked like flight data -- bizarre and impossible      flight data -- but were actually a diagnostic error message. The guidance      system had in fact shut down.<BR>         This shutdown occurred 36.7 seconds after launch, when the guidance      system's own computer tried to convert one piece of data -- the sideways      velocity of the rocket -- from a 64-bit format to a 16-bit format. The number      was too big, and an overflow error resulted. When the guidance system shut      down, it passed control to an identical, redundant unit, which was there      to provide backup in case of just such a failure. But the second unit had      failed in the identical manner a few milliseconds before. And why not? It      was running the same software.<BR>         This bug belongs to a species that has existed since the first      computer programmers realized they could store numbers as sequences of bits,      atoms of data, ones and zeroes: 1001010001101001. . . . A bug like this might      crash a spreadsheet or word processor on a bad day. Ordinarily, though, when      a program converts data from one form to another, the conversions are protected      by extra lines of code that watch for errors and recover gracefully. Indeed,      many of the data conversions in the guidance system's programming included      such protection.<BR>         But in this case, the programmers had decided that this particular      velocity figure would never be large enough to cause trouble. After all,      it never had been before. Unluckily, Ariane 5 was a faster rocket than Ariane      4. One extra absurdity: the calculation containing the bug, which shut down      the guidance system, which confused the on-board computer, which forced the      rocket off course, actually served no purpose once the rocket was in the      air. Its only function was to align the system before launch. So it should      have been turned off. But engineers chose long ago, in an earlier version      of the Ariane, to leave this function running for the first 40 seconds of      flight -- a "special feature" meant to make it easy to restart the system      in the event of a brief hold in the countdown.<BR>         The Europeans hope to launch a new Ariane 5 next spring, this      time with a newly designated "software architect" who will oversee a process      of more intensive and, they hope, realistic ground simulation. Simulation      is the great hope of software debuggers everywhere, though it can never      anticipate every feature of real life. "Very tiny details can have terrible      consequences," says Jacques Durand, head of the project, in Paris. "That's      not surprising, especially in a complex software system such as this is."<BR>         These days, we have complex software systems everywhere. We      have them in our dishwashers and in our wristwatches, though they're not      quite so mission-critical. We have computers in our cars -- from 15 to 50      microprocessors, depending how you count: in the engine, the transmission,      the suspensions, the steering, the brakes and every other major subsystem.      Each runs its own software, thoroughly tested, simulated and debugged, no      doubt.<BR>         Bill Powers, vice president for research at Ford, says that      cars' computing power is increasingly devoted not just to actual control      but to diagnostics and contingency planning -- "Should I abort the mission,      and if I abort, where would I go?" he says. "We also have what's called a      limp-home strategy." That is, in the worst case, the car is supposed to behave      more or less normally, like a car of the pre-computer era, instead of, say,      taking it upon itself to swerve into the nearest tree.<BR>         The European investigators chose not to single out any particular      contractor or department for blame. "A decision was taken," they wrote. "It      was not analyzed or fully understood." And "the possible implications of      allowing it to continue to function during flight were not realized." They      did not attempt to calculate how much time or money was saved by omitting      the standard error-protection code.<BR>         "The board wishes to point out," they added, with the magnificent      blandness of many official accident reports, "that software is an expression      of a highly detailed design and does not fail in the same sense as a mechanical      system." No. It fails in a different sense. Software built up over years      from millions of lines of code, branching and unfolding and intertwining,      comes to behave more like an organism than a machine.<BR>         "There is no life today without software," says Frank Lanza,      an executive vice president of the American rocket maker Lockheed Martin.      "The world would probably just collapse." Fortunately, he points out, really      important software has a reliability of 99.9999999 percent. At least, until      it doesn't.      <P>      <IMG SRC="000.gif" height=2 WIDTH="265"></TD>    <TD VALIGN="Top"><P ALIGN=Center>      <P>      <FONT COLOR="#A0A087"> </FONT></TD>  </TR></TABLE><P ALIGN=Center><IMG SRC="cr96.gif" ALT="Copyright 1996 James Gleick" WIDTH="230" HEIGHT="30"><BR><FONT COLOR="#A0A087"><FONT size="1">First published in the New York TimesMagazine 1 December 1996</FONT></FONT><P ALIGN=Center>       <P><P></BODY></HTML>
