<h1>The New Methodology</h1>

<p class = 'abstract'><i>
  In the past few years there's been a blossoming of a new style of
software methodology - referred to as agile methods. Alternatively
characterized as an antidote to bureaucracy or a license to hack
they've stirred up interest all over the software landscape. In this
essay I explore the reasons for agile methods, focusing not so much on
their weight but on their adaptive nature and their people-first
orientation.

<p>Probably the most noticeable change to software process
    thinking in the last few years has been the appearance of the word
    'agile'. We talk of agile software methods, of how to introduce
    agility into a development team, or of how to resist the impending
    storm of agilists determined to change well-established practices.</p>

<p>This new movement grew out of the efforts of various people who
    dealt with software process in the 1990s, found them wanting, and
    looked for a new approach to software process. Most of the ideas
    were not new, indeed many people believed that much
    successful software had been built that way for a long time. There
    was, however, a view that these ideas had been stifled and not
    been treated seriously enough, particularly by people interested
    in software process.</p>

<p>This essay was originally part of this movement. I originally
    published it in July 2000. I wrote it, like most of my essays, as
    part of trying to understand the topic. At that time I'd used
    Extreme Programming for several years after I was lucky enough to
    work with Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, Don Wells, and above all the rest of the
    Chrysler C3 team in 1996. I had since had conversations and read
    books from other people who had similar ideas about software
    process, but had not necessarily wanted to take the same path as
    Extreme Programming. So in the essay I wanted to explore what were
    the similarities and differences between these methodologies.</p>

<div class = ' sidebar'>
<p>If you are interested in historic curiosities, you can
    read the <a href = 'newMethodologyOriginal.html'>original version
    of this article</a>.  Other than formatting changes the text is
    unaltered.</p>
</div>

<p>My conclusion then, which I still believe now, is that there
    were some fundamental principles that united these methodologies,
    and these principles were a notable contrast from the assumptions
    of the established methodologies.</p>

<p>This essay has continued to be one of the most popular essays
    on my website, which means I feel somewhat bidden to keep it up to
    date. In its original form the essay
    both explored these differences in principles and provided a
    survey of agile methods as I then understood them. Too much has
    happened with agile methods since for me to keep up with the
    survey part, although I do provide some links to continue your
    explorations. The differences in principles still remain, and
    this discussion I've kept.</p>

<div id = 'FromNothingToMonumentalToAgile'><hr class = 'topSection'></hr>
<h2>From Nothing, to Monumental, to Agile</h2>

<p>Most software development is a chaotic activity, often
characterized by the phrase "code and fix". The software is written
without much of an underlying plan, and the design of the system is
cobbled together from many short term decisions. This actually works
pretty well as the system is small, but as the system grows it becomes
increasingly difficult to add new features to the system. Furthermore
bugs become increasingly prevalent and increasingly difficult to fix.
A typical sign of such a system is a long test phase after the system
is "feature complete". Such a long test phase plays havoc with
schedules as testing and debugging is impossible to schedule.
  </p>

<p>The original movement to try to change this introduced the
notion of methodology. These methodologies impose a disciplined
process upon software development with the aim of making software
development more predictable and more efficient. They do this by
developing a detailed process with a strong emphasis on planning
inspired by other engineering disciplines - which is why I like to
refer to them as <b>engineering methodologies</b> (another widely used
term for them is <b>plan-driven methodologies</b>).
  </p>

<p>Engineering methodologies have been around for a long time. They've
not been noticeable for being terribly successful. They are even less
noted for being popular. The most frequent criticism of these
methodologies is that they are bureaucratic. There's so much stuff to
do to follow the methodology that the whole pace of development slows
down. 
  </p>

<p><b>Agile methodologies</b> developed as a reaction to these
    methodologies.  For many people the appeal of these agile
methodologies is their reaction to the bureaucracy of the engineering
methodologies. These new methods attempt a useful compromise between
no process and too much process, providing just enough process to gain
a reasonable payoff.
  </p>

<p>The result of all of this is that agile methods have some
significant changes in emphasis from engineering methods. The most
immediate difference is that they are less document-oriented, usually
emphasizing a smaller amount of documentation for a given task. In
many ways they are rather code-oriented: following a route that says
that the key part of documentation is source code.
  </p>

<p>However I don't think this is the key point about agile
methods. Lack of documentation is a symptom of two much deeper
differences:
  </p>

<ul>
<li><i>Agile methods are adaptive rather than predictive.</i>
Engineering methods tend to try to plan out a large part of the software
process in great detail for a long span of time, this works well until
things change. So their nature is to resist change. The agile methods,
however, welcome change. They try to be processes that adapt and
thrive on change, even to the point of changing themselves.
  </li>

<li><i>Agile methods are people-oriented rather than
process-oriented.</i> The goal of engineering methods is to define a
process that will work well whoever happens to be using it. Agile
methods assert that no process will ever make up the skill of the
development team, so the role of a process is to support the
development team in their work.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the following sections I'll explore these differences in
more detail, so that you can understand what an adaptive and
people-centered process is like, its benefits and drawbacks, and
whether it's something you should use: either as a developer or
customer of software.
  </p>
</div>

<div id = 'PredictiveVersusAdaptive'><hr class = 'topSection'></hr>
<h2>Predictive versus Adaptive</h2>

<div id = 'SeparationOfDesignAndConstruction'>
<h3>Separation of Design and Construction</h3>

<p>The usual inspiration for methodologies is engineering
disciplines such as civil or mechanical engineering. Such disciplines
put a lot of emphasis on planning before you build. Such engineers
will work on a series of drawings that precisely indicate what needs
to be built and how these things need to be put together. Many design
decisions, such as how to deal with the load on a bridge, are made as
the drawings are produced. The drawings are then handed over to a
different group, often a different company, to be built. It's assumed
that the construction process will follow the drawings. In practice
the constructors will run into some problems, but these are usually
small.
    </p>

<p>Since the drawings specify the pieces and how they need to be
put together, they act as the foundation for a detailed construction
plan. Such a plan can figure out the tasks that need to be done and
what dependencies exist between these tasks.  This allows for a
reasonably predictable schedule and budget for construction. It also
says in detail how the people doing the construction work should do
their work. This allows the construction to be less skilled
intellectually, although they are often very skilled manually.
    </p>

<p>So what we see here are two fundamentally different
activities. <i>Design</i> which is difficult to predict and requires
expensive and creative people, and <i>construction</i> which is easier
to predict. Once we have the design, we can plan the construction.
Once we have the plan for the construction, we can then deal with
construction in a much more predictable way. In civil engineering
construction is much bigger in both cost and time than design and
planning.
    </p>

<p>So the approach for software engineering methodologies looks
like this: we want a predictable schedule that can use people with
lower skills. To do this we must separate design from construction.
Therefore we need to figure out how to do the design for software so
that the construction can be straightforward once the planning is
done.
    </p>

<p>So what form does this plan take? For many, this is the role
of design notations such as the <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321193687?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321193687">UML</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>. If
we can make all the significant decisions using the UML, we can build
a construction plan and then hand these designs off to coders as a
construction activity.
    </p>

<p>But here lies the crucial question. Can you get a design that is
capable of turning the coding into a predictable construction
activity? And if so, is cost of doing this sufficiently small to make
this approach worthwhile?
    </p>

<p>All of this brings a few questions to mind. The first is the
matter of how difficult it is to get a UML-like design into a state
that it can be handed over to programmers. The problem with a UML-like
design is that it can look very good on paper, yet be seriously flawed
when you actually have to program the thing. The models that civil
engineers use are based on many years of practice that are enshrined
in engineering codes. Furthermore the key issues, such as the way
forces play in the design, are amenable to mathematical analysis. The
only checking we can do of UML-like diagrams is peer review. While
this is helpful it leads to errors in the design that are often only
uncovered during coding and testing. Even skilled designers, such as I
consider myself to be, are often surprised when we turn such a design
into software.
    </p>

<p>Another issue is that of comparative cost. When you build a
bridge, the cost of the design effort is about 10% of the job, with
the rest being construction. In software the amount of time spent in
coding is much, much less <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1556159005?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1556159005">McConnell</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/> suggests that for a large
project, only 15% of the project is code and unit test, an almost
perfect reversal of the bridge building ratios. Even if you lump in
all testing as part of construction, then design is still 50% of the
work. This raises an important question about the nature of design in
software compared to its role in other branches of engineering.
    </p>

<p>These kinds of questions led Jack Reeves to <a href = 'http://www.bleading-edge.com/Publications/C++Journal/Cpjour2.htm'>suggest</a> that in fact the source code is a
design document and that the construction phase is actually the use of
the compiler and linker. Indeed anything that you can treat as
construction can and should be automated.
    </p>

<p>This thinking leads to some important conclusions: </p>

<ul>
<li>In software: construction is so cheap as to be free</li>

<li>In software all the effort is design, and thus requires
creative and talented people</li>

<li>Creative processes are not easily planned, and so
predictability may well be an impossible target.</li>

<li>We should be very wary of the traditional engineering
metaphor for building software. It's a different kind of activity and
requires a different process</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id = 'TheUnpredictabilityOfRequirements'>
<h3>The Unpredictability of Requirements</h3>

<p>There's a refrain I've heard on every problem project I've
run into. The developers come to me and say "the problem with this
project is that the requirements are always changing". The thing I
find surprising about this situation is that anyone is surprised by
it. In building business software requirements changes are the norm,
the question is what we do about it.
    </p>

<p>One route is to treat changing requirements as the result of
poor requirements engineering. The idea behind requirements
engineering is to get a fully understood picture of the requirements
before you begin building the software, get a customer sign-off to
these requirements, and then set up procedures that limit requirements
changes after the sign-off.
    </p>

<p>One problem with this is that just trying to understand the
options for requirements is tough. It's even tougher because the
development organization usually doesn't provide cost information on
the requirements. You end up being in the situation where you may have
some desire for a sun roof on your car, but the salesman can't tell
you if it adds $10 to the cost of the car, or $10,000. Without much
idea of the cost, how can you figure out whether you want to pay for
that sunroof?
    </p>

<p>Estimation is hard for many reasons. Part of it is that
software development is a design activity, and thus hard to plan and
cost. Part of it is that the basic materials keep changing rapidly.
Part of it is that so much depends on which individual people are
involved, and individuals are hard to predict and quantify.
    </p>

<p>Software's intangible nature also cuts in. It's very
difficult to see what value a software feature has until you use it
for real. Only when you use an early version of some software do you
really begin to understand what features are valuable and what parts
are not.
    </p>

<p>This leads to the ironic point that people expect that
requirements should be changeable. After all software is supposed to
be <i>soft.</i> So not just are requirements changeable, they ought to
be changeable. It takes a lot of energy to get customers of software
to fix requirements. It's even worse if they've ever dabbled in
software development themselves, because then they "know" that
software is easy to change.
    </p>

<p>But even if you could settle all that and really could get an
accurate and stable set of requirements you're probably still doomed.
In today's economy the fundamental business forces are changing the
value of software features too rapidly. What might be a good set of
requirements now, is not a good set in six months time. Even if the
customers can fix their requirements, the business world isn't going
to stop for them. And many changes in the business world are
completely unpredictable: anyone who says otherwise is either lying,
or has already made a billion on stock market trading.
    </p>

<p>Everything else in software development depends on the
requirements. If you cannot get stable requirements you cannot get a
predictable plan.
    </p>
</div>

<div id = 'IsPredictabilityImpossible'>
<h3>Is Predictability Impossible?</h3>

<p>In general, no. There are some software developments where
predictability is possible. Organizations such as NASA's space shuttle
software group are a prime example of where software development can
be predictable. It requires a lot of ceremony, plenty of time, a large
team, and stable requirements. There are projects out there that are
space shuttles. However I don't think much business software fits into
that category. For this you need a different kind of process.
    </p>

<p>One of the big dangers is to pretend that you can follow a
predictable process when you can't. People who work on methodology are
not very good at identifying boundary conditions: the places where the
methodology passes from appropriate to inappropriate. Most
methodologists want their methodologies to be usable by everyone, so
they don't understand nor publicize their boundary conditions. This
leads to people using a methodology in the wrong circumstances, such
as using a predictable methodology in a unpredictable situation.
    </p>

<p>There's a strong temptation to do that. Predictability is a
very desirable property. However if you believe you can be predictable
when you can't, it leads to situations where people build a plan early
on, then don't properly handle the situation where the plan falls
apart. You see the plan and reality slowly drifting apart. For a long
time you can pretend that the plan is still valid. But at some point
the drift becomes too much and the plan falls apart. Usually the fall
is painful.
    </p>

<p>So if you are in a situation that isn't predictable you can't
use a predictive methodology. That's a hard blow. It means that many
of the models for controlling projects, many of the models for the
whole customer relationship, just aren't true any more. The benefits
of predictability are so great, it's difficult to let them go. Like so
many problems the hardest part is simply realizing that the problem
exists.
    </p>

<p>However letting go of predictability doesn't mean you have to
revert to uncontrollable chaos. Instead you need a process that can
give you control over an unpredictability. That's what adaptivity is
all about.
    </p>
</div>

<div id = 'ControllingAnUnpredictableProcess-Iterations'>
<h3>Controlling an Unpredictable Process - Iterations</h3>

<p>So how do we control ourselves in an unpredictable world? The
most important, and still difficult part is to know accurately where
we are. We need an honest feedback mechanism which can accurately tell
us what the situation is at frequent intervals.
    </p>

<p>The key to this feedback is iterative development. This is
<a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131111558?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0131111558">not a new idea</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>. Iterative
development has been around for a while under many names: incremental,
evolutionary, staged, spiral... lots of names. The key to iterative
development is to frequently produce working versions of the final
system that have a subset of the required features. These working
systems are short on functionality, but should otherwise be faithful
to the demands of the final system. They should be fully integrated
and as carefully tested as a final delivery.
    </p>

<p>The point of this is that there is nothing like a tested,
integrated system for bringing a forceful dose of reality into any
project. Documents can hide all sorts of flaws. Untested code can hide
plenty of flaws. But when people actually sit in front of a system and
work with it, then flaws become truly apparent: both in terms of bugs
and in terms of misunderstood requirements.
    </p>

<p>Iterative development makes sense in predictable processes as
well. But it is essential in adaptive processes because an adaptive
process needs to be able to deal with changes in required features.
This leads to a style of planning where long term plans are very
fluid, and the only stable plans are short term plans that are made
for a single iteration. Iterative development gives you a firm
foundation in each iteration that you can base your later plans
around.
    </p>

<p>A key question for this is how long an iteration should be.
Different people give different answers. XP suggests iterations of
 one or two weeks. SCRUM suggests a length of a month.
Crystal may stretch further. The tendency, however, is to make each
iteration as short as you can get away with. This provides more
frequent feedback, so you know where you are more often.
    </p>
</div>

<div id = 'TheAdaptiveCustomer'>
<h3>The Adaptive Customer</h3>

<p>This kind of adaptive process requires a different kind of
relationship with a customer than the ones that are often considered,
particularly when development is done by a separate firm. When you
hire a separate firm to do software development, most customers would
prefer a fixed-price contract. Tell the developers what they want, ask
for bids, accept a bid, and then the onus is on the development
organization to build the software.
    </p>

<p>A fixed price contract requires stable requirements and hence
a predictive process. Adaptive processes and unstable requirements
imply you cannot work with the usual notion of fixed-price. Trying to
fit a fixed price model to an adaptive process ends up in a very
painful explosion. The nasty part of this explosion is that the
customer gets hurt every bit as much as the software development
company. After all the customer wouldn't be wanting some software
unless their business needed it. If they don't get it their business
suffers. So even if they pay the development company nothing, they
still lose. Indeed they lose more than they would pay for the software
(why would they pay for the software if the business value of that
software were less?)
    </p>

<p>So there's dangers for both sides in signing the traditional
fixed price contract in conditions where a predictive process cannot
be used. This means that the customer has to work differently.
    </p>

<p>This doesn't mean that you can't fix a budget for software
up-front. What it does mean is that you cannot fix time, price and
scope. The usual agile approach is to fix time and price, and to allow
the scope to vary in a controlled manner. </p>

<p>In an adaptive process the customer has much finer-grained
control over the software development process. At every iteration they
get both to check progress and to alter the direction of the software
development. This leads to much closer relationship with the software
developers, a true business partnership. This level of engagement is
not for every customer organization, nor for every software developer;
but it's essential to make an adaptive process work properly.
</p>

<p>All this yields a number of advantages for the customer. For
      a start they get much more responsive
software development. A usable, although minimal, system can go into
production early on. The customer can then change its capabilities
according to changes in the business, and also from learning from how
the system is used in reality.
  </p>

<p>Every bit as important as this is greater visibility into the
true state of the project. The problem with predictive processes is
that project quality is measured by conformance to plan. This makes it
difficult for people to signal when reality and the plan diverge. The
common result is a big slip in the schedule late in the project. In an
agile project there is a constant reworking of the plan with every
iteration. If bad news is lurking it tends to come earlier, when there
is still time to do something about it. Indeed this risk control is a
key advantage of iterative development.</p>

<p> Agile methods take this
further by keeping the iteration lengths small, but also by seeing
these variations in a different way. Mary Poppendieck summed up this
difference in viewpoint best for me with her phrase <i>"A late change in
requirements is a competitive advantage"</i>. I think most people have
noticed that it's very difficult for business people to really
understand what they need from software in the beginning. Often we see
that people learn during the process what elements are valuable and
which ones aren't. Often the most valuable features aren't at all
obvious until customer have had a chance to play with the
software. Agile methods seek to take advantage of this, encouraging
business people to learn about their needs as the system gets built,
and to build the system in such a way that changes can be incorporated
quickly.</p>

<div class = ' sidebar'>
<p>For my keynote at the first
          XP/Agile conference (XP 2000) I prepared <a href = 'designDead.html'>Is Design Dead:</a> an essay that explores the
          role of design in extreme programming.</p>
</div>

<p>All this has an important bearing what constitutes a successful
project. A predictive project is often measured by how well it met its
plan. A project that's on-time and on-cost is considered to be a
success. This measurement is nonsense to an agile environment. For
agilists the question is business value - did the customer get
software that's more valuable to them than the cost put into it.
A good predictive project will go according to plan, a good agile
project will build something different and better than the original
plan foresaw.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id = 'PuttingPeopleFirst'><hr class = 'topSection'></hr>
<h2>Putting People First</h2>

<p>Executing an adaptive process is not easy. In particular it
requires a very effective team of developers. The team needs to be
effective both in the quality of the individuals, and in the way the
team blends together. There's also an interesting synergy: not just
does adaptivity require a strong team, most good developers prefer an
adaptive process.
  </p>

<div id = 'Plug-compatibleProgrammingUnits'>
<h3>Plug-Compatible Programming Units</h3>

<p>One of the aims of traditional methodologies is to develop a
process where the people involved are replaceable parts.  With such a
process you can treat people as resources who are available in various
types. You have an analyst, some coders, some testers, a manager. The
individuals aren't so important, only the roles are important. That
way if you plan a project it doesn't matter which analyst and which
testers you get, just that you know how many you have so you know how
the number of resources affects your plan.
  </p>

<p>But this raises a key question: are the people involved in
software development replaceable parts? One of the key features of
agile methods is that they reject this assumption.
  </p>

<p>Perhaps the most explicit rejection of people as resources is
Alistair Cockburn. In his paper <a href = 'http://alistair.cockburn.us/Characterizing+people+as+non-linear%2c+first-order+components+in+software+development'>Characterizing People as Non-Linear,
First-Order Components in Software Development</a>, he makes the
point that predictable processes require components that behave in a
predictable way. However people are not predictable components.
Furthermore his studies of software projects have led him to conclude
the people are the most important factor in software development. </p>

<blockquote>
<p> In the title, [of his article]
I refer to people as "components". That is how people are treated in
the process / methodology design literature. The mistake in this
approach is that "people" are highly variable and non-linear, with
unique success and failure modes. Those factors are first-order, not
negligible factors. Failure of process and methodology designers to
account for them contributes to the sorts of unplanned project
trajectories we so often see.</p>

<p class = 'quote-attribution'>-- <a href = 'http://alistair.cockburn.us/Characterizing+people+as+non-linear%2c+first-order+components+in+software+development'>[Cockburn non-linear]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One wonders if not the nature of software development works
against us here. When we're programming a computer, we control an
inherently predictable device. Since we're in this business because
we are good at doing that, we are ideally suited to messing up when
faced with human beings. </p>

<p> Although Cockburn is the most explicit in his people-centric
view of software development, the notion of people first is a common
theme with many thinkers in software. The problem, too often, is that
methodology has been opposed to the notion of people as the
first-order factor in project success.
  </p>

<p>This creates a strong positive feedback effect. If you expect
all your developers to be plug-compatible programming units, you don't
try to treat them as individuals. This lowers morale (and
productivity). The good people look for a better place to be, and you
end up with what you desire: plug-compatible programming units.
  </p>

<p>Deciding that people come first is a big decision, one that
requires a lot of determination to push through. The notion of people
as resources is deeply ingrained in business thinking, its roots going
back to the impact of <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140260803?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0140260803"> Frederick

In running a factory,
this Taylorist approach may make sense. But for the highly creative and
professional work, which I believe software development to be, this
does not hold. (And in fact modern manufacturing is also moving away
from the Taylorist model.)
  </p>
</div>

<div id = 'ProgrammersAreResponsibleProfessionals'>
<h3>Programmers are Responsible Professionals</h3>

<p>A key part of the Taylorist notion is that the people doing
the work are not the people who can best figure out how best to do
that work. In a factory this may be true for several reasons. Part of
this is that many factory workers are not the most intelligent or
creative people, in part this is because there is a tension between
management and workers in that management makes more money when the
workers make less.
  </p>

<p>Recent history increasingly shows us how untrue this is for
software development. Increasingly bright and capable people are
attracted to software development, attracted by both its glitz and by
potentially large rewards. (Both of which tempted me away from
electronic engineering.) Despite the downturn of the early 00's, there
is still a great deal of talent and creativity in software development.
  </p>

<p>(There may well be a generational effect here. Some anecdotal
evidence makes me wonder if more brighter people have ventured into
software engineering in the last fifteen years or so. If so this would be
a reason for why there is such a cult of youth in the computer
business, like most cults there needs to be a grain of truth in it.)
  </p>

<p>When you want to hire and retain good people, you have to
recognize that they are competent professionals. As such they are the
best people to decide how to conduct their technical work. The
Taylorist notion of a separate planning department that decides how to
do things only works if the planners understand how to do the job
better than those doing it. If you have bright, motivated people doing
the job then this does not hold.
  </p>
</div>

<div id = 'ManagingAPeopleOrientedProcess'>
<h3>Managing a People Oriented Process</h3>

<p>People orientation manifests itself in a number of different
ways in agile processes. It leads to different effects, not all of
them are consistent.
  </p>

<p>One of the key elements is that of accepting the process
rather than the imposition of a process. Often software processes are
imposed by management figures. As such they are often resisted,
particularly when the management figures have had a significant amount
of time away from active development. Accepting a process requires
commitment, and as such needs the active involvement of all the team.
  </p>

<p>This ends up with the interesting result that only the
developers themselves can choose to follow an adaptive process. This
is particularly true for XP, which requires a lot of discipline to
execute. Crystal considers itself as a less disciplined approach
that's appropriate for a wider audience.
  </p>

<p>Another point is that the developers must be able to make
<i>all</i> technical decisions. XP gets to the heart of this where in
its planning process it states that only developers may make estimates
on how much time it will take to do some work.
  </p>

<p>Such technical leadership is a big shift for many people in
management positions. Such an approach requires a sharing of
responsibility where developers and management have an equal place in
the leadership of the project. Notice that I say <i>equal</i>.
Management still plays a role, but recognizes the expertise of
developers.
  </p>

<p>An important reason for this is the rate of change of
technology in our industry. After a few years technical knowledge
becomes obsolete. This half life of technical skills is without
parallel in any other industry. Even technical people have to
recognize that entering management means their technical skills will
wither rapidly. Ex-developers need to recognize that their technical
skills will rapidly disappear and they need to trust and rely on
current developers.
  </p>
</div>

<div id = 'TheDifficultyOfMeasurement'>
<h3>The Difficulty of Measurement</h3>

<p>If you have a process where  the people who say how work
should be done are different from the people who actually do it, the
leaders need some way of measuring how effective the doers are. In
Scientific Management there was a strong push to develop objective
approaches to measuring the output of people. </p>

<p>This is particularly relevant to software because of the
difficulty of applying measurement to software. Despite our best
efforts we are unable to measure the most simple things about
software, such as productivity. Without good measures for these
things, any kind of external control is doomed.</p>

<p>Introducing measured management without good measures leads to
its own problems. <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932633366?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0932633366">Robert Austin</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/> made an
excellent discussion of this. He points out that when measuring
performance you have to get <i>all</i> the important factors under
measurement. Anything that's missing has the inevitable result that
the doers will alter what they do to produce the best measures, even
if that clearly reduces the true effectiveness of what they do. This
measurement dysfunction is the Achilles heel of measurement-based management.</p>

<p>Austin's conclusion is that you have to choose between
measurement-base management and delegatory management (where the doers
decide how to do the work). Measurement-based management is best suited
to repetitive simple work, with low knowledge requirements and easily
measured outputs - exactly the opposite of software development.</p>

<p>The point of all this is that traditional methods have
operated under the assumption that measurement-based management is the
most efficient way of managing. The agile community recognizes that
the characteristics of software development are such that measurement
based management leads to very high levels of measurement dysfunction.
It's actually more efficient to use a delegatory style of management,
which is the kind of approach that is at the center of the agilist
viewpoint.</p>
</div>

<div id = 'TheRoleOfBusinessLeadership'>
<h3>The Role of Business Leadership</h3>

<p>But the technical people cannot do the whole process
themselves. They need guidance on the business needs. This leads to
another important aspect of adaptive processes: they need very close
contact with business expertise.
  </p>

<p>This goes beyond most projects involvement of the business
role. Agile teams cannot exist with occasional communication . They
need continuous access to business expertise. Furthermore this access
is not something that is handled at a management level, it is
something that is present for every developer. Since developers are
capable professionals in their own discipline, they need to be able to
work as equals with other professionals in other disciplines.
  </p>

<p>A large part of this, of course, is due to the nature of
adaptive development. Since the whole premise of adaptive development
is that things change quickly, you need constant contact to advise
everybody of the changes.
  </p>

<p>There is nothing more frustrating to a developer than seeing
their hard work go to waste. So it's important to ensure that there is
good quality business expertise that is both available to the
developer and is of sufficient quality that the developer can trust
them.
  </p>
</div>
</div>

<div id = 'TheSelf-adaptiveProcess'><hr class = 'topSection'></hr>
<h2>The Self-Adaptive Process</h2>

<p>So far I've talked about adaptivity in the context of a project
adapting its software frequently to meet the changing requirements of
its customers. However there's another angle to adaptivity: that of
the process changing over time. A project that begins using an
adaptive process won't have the same process a year later. Over time,
the team will find what works for them, and alter the process to fit.
  </p>

<p>The first part of self-adaptivity is regular reviews of the
process. Usually you do these with every iteration. At the end of each
iteration, have a short meeting and ask yourself the following
questions (culled from <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932633447?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0932633447">Norm
Kerth</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>)</p>

<ul>
<li>What did we do well?</li>

<li>What have we learned?</li>

<li>What can we do better?</li>

<li>What puzzles us?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions will lead you to ideas to change the process
for the next iteration. In this way a process that starts off with
problems can improve as the project goes on, adapting better to the
team that uses it.
  </p>

<p>If self-adaptivity occurs within a project, it's even more
marked across an organization. A consequence of self-adaptivity is
that you should never expect to find a single corporate methodology.
Instead each team should not just choose their own process, but should
also actively tune their process as they proceed with the project.
While both published processes and the experience of other projects
can act as an inspiration and a baseline, the developers professional
responsibility is to adapt the process to the task at hand.
  </p>

<div id = 'FlavorsOfAgileDevelopment'><hr class = 'topSection'></hr>
<h2>Flavors of Agile Development</h2>

<p>The term 'agile' refers to a philosophy of software
development. Under this broad umbrella sits many more specific
approaches such as Extreme Programming, Scrum, Lean Development, etc.
Each of these more particular approaches has its own ideas,
communities and leaders. Each community is a distinct group of its own
but to be correctly called agile it should follow the same broad
principles. Each community also borrows from ideas and techniques from
each other. Many practitioners move between different communities
spreading different ideas around - all in all it's a complicated but
vibrant ecosystem.</p>

<p>So far I've given my take on the overall picture of my
definition of agile. Now I want to introduce some of the different
agile communities. I can only give a quick overview here, but I do
include references so you can dig further if you like.</p>

<p>Since I'm about to start giving more references, this is a
good point to point out some sources for general information on agile
methods. The web-center is the <a href = 'http://agileAlliance.org'>Agile
Alliance</a> a non-profit set up to encourage and research agile
software development. For books I'd suggest overviews by <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321482751?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321482751">Alistair Cockburn</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/> and <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201760436?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201760436">Jim Highsmith</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>.

on agile methods look at the appropriate sections of my <a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/articles.html'>articles</a> and <a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/agile.html'>blog</a>.</p>

<p>The following list is by no means complete. It reflects a
personal selection of the flavors of agile that have most interested
and influenced me over the last decade or so.</p>

<div id = 'AgileManifesto'>
<h3>Agile Manifesto</h3>

<p>The term 'agile' got hijacked for this activity in early
2001 when a bunch of people who had been heavily involved in this work
got together to exchange ideas and came up with the <a href = 'http://www.agileManifesto.org'>Manifesto for Agile Software
Development</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to this workshop a number of different groups had
been developing similar ideas about software development. Most, but by
no means all, of this work had come out of the Object-Oriented
software community that had long advocated iterative development
approaches. This essay was originally written in 2000 to try to pull
together these various threads. At that time there was no common name
for these approaches, but the moniker 'lightweight' had grown up
around them. Many of the people involved didn't feel this was a good
term as it didn't accurately convey the essence of what these
approaches were about.</p>

<p>There had been some talking about broader issues in these
approaches in 2000 at a workshop hosted by Kent Beck in Oregon.
Although this workshop was focused on Extreme Programming (the
community that at that time had gained the most attention) several non
XPers had attended. One the discussions that came up was whether it
was better for XP to be a broad or concrete movement. Kent preferred a
more focused cohesive community.</p>

<p>The workshop was organized, if I remember correctly,
primarily by Jim Highsmith and Bob Martin. They contacted people who
they felt were active in communities with these similar ideas and got
seventeen of them together for the Snowbird workshop. The initial idea
was just to get together and build better understanding of each
others' approaches. Robert Martin was keen to get some statement, a
manifesto that could be used to rally the industry behind these kinds
of techniques. We also decided we wanted to choose a name to act as an
umbrella name for the various approaches.</p>

<p>During the course of the workshop we decided to use 'agile'
as the umbrella name, and came up with values part of the manifesto.
The principles section was started at the workshop but mostly
developed on a wiki afterwards.</p>

<p>The effort clearly struck a nerve, I think we were all very
surprised at the degree of attention and appreciation the manifesto
got. Although the manifesto is hardly a rigorous definition of agile,
it does provide a focusing statement that helps concentrate the ideas.
Shortly after we finished the manifesto Jim Highsmith and I wrote an
<a href = 'http://www.sdmagazine.com/documents/s=844/sdm0108a/0108a.htm'>article for SD Magazine</a>
that provided some commentary to the manifesto.
        </p>

<p>Later that year, most of the seventeen who wrote the
manifesto got back together again, with quite a few others, at OOPSLA
2001. There was a suggestion that the manifesto authors should begin
some on-going agile movement, but the authors agreed that they were
just the people who happened to turn up for that workshop and produced
that manifesto. There was no way that that group could claim leadership
of the whole agile community. We had helped launch the ship and should
let it go for whoever who wanted to sail in her to do so. So that was
the end of the seventeen manifesto authors as an organized body.</p>

<p>One next step that did follow, with the active involvement
of many of these authors, was the formation of the <a href = 'http://agileAlliance.org'>agile alliance</a>. This group is a
non-profit group intended to promote and research agile methods.
Amongst other things it sponsors an annual conference in the US.</p>
</div>

<div id = 'xp'>
<h3>XP (Extreme Programming)</h3>

<p>During the early popularity of agile methods in the late
1990's, Extreme Programming was the one that got the lion's share of
attention. In many ways it still does.</p>

<p>The roots of XP lie in the Smalltalk community, and in
particular the close collaboration of Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham in
the late 1980's. Both of them refined their practices on numerous
projects during the early 90's, extending their ideas of a software
development approach that was both adaptive and people-oriented.</p>

<p>Kent continued to develop his ideas during consulting
engagements, in particular the <a href = 'http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/C3.html'>Chrysler C3
project</a>, which has since become known as the creation project of
extreme programming. He started using the term 'extreme programming'
around 1997. (C3 also marked my initial contact with Extreme
Programming and the beginning of my friendship with Kent.)</p>

<p>During the late 1990's word of Extreme Programming spread,
initially through descriptions on newsgroups and Ward Cunningham's
wiki, where Kent and Ron Jeffries (a colleague at C3) spent a lot of
time explaining and debating the various ideas. Finally a number of
books were published towards the end of the 90's and start of 00's
that went into some detail explaining the various aspects of the
approach. Most of these books took Kent Beck's <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201616416?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201616416">white book</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/> as their foundation. Kent
produced a <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321278658?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321278658">second edition</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/> of the white
book in 2004 which was a significant re-articulation of the
approach.</p>

<p>XP begins with five values (Communication, Feedback,
Simplicity, Courage, and Respect). It then elaborates these into
fourteen principles and again into twenty-four practices. The idea is
that practices are concrete things that a team can do day-to-day,
while values are the fundamental knowledge and understanding that
underpins the approach. Values without practices are hard to apply and
can be applied in so many ways that it's hard to know where to start.
Practices without values are rote activities without a purpose. Both
values and practices are needed, but there's a big gap between them -
the principles help bridge that gap. Many of XP's practices are old,
tried and tested techniques, yet often forgotten by many, including
most planned processes. As well as resurrecting these techniques, XP
weaves them into a synergistic whole where each one is reinforced by
the others and given purpose by the values.</p>

<p>One of the most striking, as well as initially appealing to
me, is its strong emphasis on testing. While all processes mention
testing, most do so with a pretty low emphasis. However XP puts
testing at the foundation of development, with every programmer
writing tests as they write their production code. The tests are
integrated into a continuous integration and build process which
yields a highly stable platform for future development. XP's approach
here, often described under the heading of <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321146530 ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321146530 ">Test

haven't adopted much else of XP.
  </p>

<p>There's a great deal of publications about extreme
programming. One area of confusion, however, is the shift between the
first and second edition of the white book. I said above that
the second edition is a 're-articulation' of extreme programming, in
that the approach is still the same but it is described in a different
style. The first edition (with four values, twelve practices and some
important but mostly-ignored principles) had a huge influence on the
software industry and most descriptions of extreme programming were
written based on the first edition's description. Keep that in mind as
you read material on XP, particularly if it was prepared prior to
2005. Indeed most of the common web descriptions of XP are based on
the first edition.</p>

<p>The natural starting place to discover more is the <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321278658?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321278658">second edition of the white book</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>. This book
explains the background and practices of XP in a short (160 page)
package. Kent Beck edited a multi-colored series of books on extreme
programming around the turn of the century, if forced to pick one to
suggest I'd go for the <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201616408?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201616408">purple one</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>,
remember that like most material it's based on the first edition.</p>

<p>There's a lot of material on the web about XP but most of
it is based on the first edition. One of the few descriptions I know
of that takes account of the second edition is a paper on <a href = 'http://www.agilexp.org/downloads/TheNewXP.pdf'>The New XP</a>
(PDF) by Michele Marchesi who hosted the original XP conferences in
Sardinia. For discussion on XP there is a <a href = 'http://www.egroups.com/group/extremeprogramming/'>yahoo
mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>My involvement in the early days and friendships within the
XP community mean that I have a distinct familiarity, fondness and
bias towards XP. I think its influence owes to marrying the
principles of agile development with a solid set of techniques for
actually carrying them out. Much of the early writings on agile
neglected the latter, raising questions about whether the agile ideas
were really possible. XP provided the tools by which the hopes of
agility could be realized.</p>

<div id = 'Scrum'>
<h3>Scrum</h3>

<p>Scrum also developed in the 80's and 90's primarily with OO
development circles as a highly iterative development methodology.
It's most well known developers were Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland,
and Mike Beedle.</p>

<p>Scrum concentrates on the management aspects of software
development, dividing development into thirty day iterations (called
'sprints') and applying closer monitoring and control with daily scrum
meetings. It places much less emphasis on engineering practices and
many people combine its project management approach with extreme
programming's engineering practices. (XP's management practices aren't
really very different.)</p>

<p>Ken Schwaber is one of the most active proponents of Scrum,
his <a href = 'http://www.controlchaos.com'>website</a> is a good place to
start looking for more information and his <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/073561993X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=073561993X">book</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/> is probably the best first
reference.</p>
</div>

<div id = 'Crystal'>
<h3>Crystal</h3>

<p>Alistair Cockburn has long been one of the principal voices
in the agile community. He developed the Crystal family of software
development methods as a group of approaches tailored to different
size teams. Crystal is seen as a family because Alistair believes that
different approaches are required as teams vary in size and the
criticality of errors changes.</p>

<p>Despite their variations all crystal approaches share
common features. All crystal methods have three priorities: safety (in
project outcome), efficiency, habitability (developers can live with
crystal). They also share common properties, of which the most
important three are: Frequent Delivery, Reflective Improvement, and
Close Communication.</p>

<p>The habitability priority is an important part of the
crystal mind-set. Alistair's quest (as I see it) is looking for what
is the least amount of process you can do and still succeed with an
underlying assumption of low-discipline that is inevitable with
humans. As a result Alistair sees Crystal as requiring less discipline
than extreme programming, trading off less efficiency for a greater
habitability and reduced chances of failure.</p>

<p>Despite Crystal's outline, there isn't a comprehensive
description of all its manifestations. The most well described is
<a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201699478?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201699478">Crystal Clear</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>, which has a modern
book description. There is also a <a href = 'http://alistair.cockburn.us/crystal/wiki'>wiki</a> for further material and discussion of
Crystal.</p>
</div>

<div id = 'ContextDrivenTesting'>
<h3>Context Driven Testing</h3>

<p>From the beginning it's been software developers who have
been driving the agile community. However many other people are
involved in software development and are affected by this new
movement. One obvious such group is testers, who often live in a world
very much contained by waterfall thinking. With common guidelines that
state that the role of testing is to ensure conformance of software to
up-front written specifications, the role of testers in an agile world
is far from clear.</p>

<p>As it turns out, several people in the testing community
have been questioning much of mainstream testing thinking for quite a
while. This has led to a group known as context-driven testing. The
best description of this is the book <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471081124?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0471081124">Lessons Learned in Software Testing</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>. This
community is also very active on the web, take a look at sites hosted
by <a href = 'http://testing.com'>Brian Marick</a> (one of the authors
of the agile manifesto), <a href = 'http://pettichord.com/'>Brett
Pettichord</a>, <a href = 'http://www.satisfice.com/'>James Bach</a>,
and <a href = 'http://www.kaner.com/'>Cem Kaner</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id = 'LeanDevelopment'>
<h3>Lean Development</h3>

<p>I remember a few years ago giving a talk about agile
methods at the Software Development conference and talking to an eager
woman about parallels between the agile ideas and lean movement in
manufacturing. Mary Poppendieck (and husband Tom) have gone on to be
active supporters of the agile community, in particular looking at the
overlaps and inspirations between lean production and software
development.</p>

<p>The lean movement in manufacturing was pioneered by Taiichi
Ohno at Toyota and is often known as the Toyota Production System.
Lean production was an inspiration to many of the early agilists - the
Poppendiecks are most notable to describing how these ideas interact.
In general I'm very wary of these kinds of reasoning by analogy,
indeed the engineering separation between design and construction got
us into this mess in the first place. However analogies can lead to
        good ideas and I think the lean ideas have introduced many
        useful ideas and tools into the agile movement.</p>

<p>The Poppendiecks' <a href = 'poppendieck-lean'>book</a> and
<a href = 'http://www.poppendieck.com'>website</a> are the obvious
starting points for more information.</p>
</div>

<div id = 'rationalUnifiedProcess'>
<h3>(Rational) Unified Process</h3>

<p>Another well-known process to have come out of the
object-oriented community is the Rational Unified Process (sometimes
just referred to as the Unified Process). The original idea was that
like the UML unified modeling languages the UP could unify software
processes. Since RUP appeared about the same time as the agile
methods, there's a lot of discussion about whether the two are
compatible.</p>

<p>RUP is a very large collection of practices and is really a
process <i>framework</i> rather than a process. Rather than give a
single process for software development it seeks to provide a common
set of practices for teams to choose from for an individual project.
As a result a team's first step using RUP should be to define their
individual process, or as RUP calls it, a <i>development case</i>.</p>

<p>The key common aspects of RUP is that it is Use Case Driven
(development is driven through user-visible features), iterative, and
architecture centric (there's a priority to building a architecture
early on that will last the project through).</p>

<p>My experience with RUP is that its problem is its infinite
variability. I've seen descriptions of RUP usage that range from
rigid waterfall with 'analysis iterations' to picture perfect agile.
It's struck me that the desire of people to market the RUP as the
single process led to a result where people can do just about anything
and call it RUP - resulting in RUP being a meaningless phrase.</p>

<p>Despite all this there are some very strong people in the
RUP community that are very much aligned with agile thinking. I've
been impressed in all my meeting with Phillippe Kruchten and his <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321197704?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321197704">book</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/> is best starting point for RUP. Craig
Larman has also developed descriptions of working with RUP in an agile
style in his popular <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131489062?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0131489062">introductory book</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>

<div id = 'ShouldYouGoAgile'><hr class = 'topSection'></hr>
<h2>Should you go agile?</h2>

<p>Using an agile method is not for everyone. There are a number of
things to bear in mind if you decide to follow this path. However I
certainly believe that these methodologies are widely applicable
and should be used by more people than currently consider them.
  </p>

<p>In today's environment, the most common methodology is code and
fix. Applying more discipline than chaos will almost certainly help,
and the agile approach has the advantage that it is much less of a
step than using a heavyweight method. Here the light weight of 
 agile methods is an advantage. Simpler processes are
more likely to be followed when you are used to no process at all.
  </p>

<p>For someone new to agile methods, the question is where to
      start. As with any new technology or process, you need to make
      your own evaluation of it. This allows you to see how it fits
      into your environment. As a result much of my advice here
      follows that I've given for other new approaches, bringing back
      memories of when I was first talking about Object-Oriented
      techniques.</p>

<p>The first step is to find suitable projects to try agile
      methods out with. Since agile methods are so fundamentally
      people-oriented, it's essential that you start with a team that
      wants to try and work in an agile way. Not just is a reluctant
      team more difficult to work with, imposing agile methods on
      reluctant people is fundamentally at odds with the whole notion
      of agile development.</p>

<p>It's valuable to also have customers (those who need the
      software) who want to work in this kind of collaborative way. If
      customers don't collaborate, then you won't see the full advantages
      of an adaptive process. Having said that we've found on several
      occasions that we've worked with customers who didn't want to
      collaborate, but changed their mind over the first few months as
      they begun to understand the agile approach.</p>

<p>A lot of people claim that agile methods can't be used on
      large projects. We (ThoughtWorks) have had good success with
      agile projects with around 100 people and multiple
      continents. Despite this I would suggest picking something
      smaller to start with. Large projects are inherently more
      difficult anyway, so it's better to start learning on a project
      of a more manageable size.</p>

<p>Some people advise picking a project with little business
      impact to start with, that way if anything goes wrong then
      there's less damage. However an unimportant project often makes
      a poor test since nobody cares much about the outcome. I prefer
      to advise people to take a project that's a little bit more
      critical than you are comfortable with.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important thing you can do is find someone
      more experienced in agile methods to help you learn. Whenever
      anyone does anything new they inevitably make mistakes. Find
      someone who has already made lots of mistakes so you can avoid
      making those yourself. Again this is something true for any new
      technology or technique, a good mentor is worth her weight in
      gold. Of course this advice is self serving since ThoughtWorks
      and many of my friends in the industry do mentoring on agile
      methods. That doesn't alter the fact that I strongly believe in
      the importance of finding a good mentor.</p>

<p>And once you've found a good mentor, follow their
      advice. It's very easy to second guess much of this and I've
      learned from experience that many techniques can't really be
      understood until you've made a reasonable attempt to try them
      out. One of the best examples I heard was a client of ours who
      decided to trial extreme programming for a couple of
      months. During that period they made it clear that they would
      do whatever the mentor said - even if they thought it was a bad
      idea. At the end of that trial period they would stop and decide
      if they wanted to carry on with any of the ideas or revert to
      the previous way of working. (In case you were wondering they
      decided to carry on with XP.)</p>

<p>One of the open questions about agile methods is where the
      boundary conditions lie. One of the problems with any new
      technique is that you aren't really aware of where the boundary
      conditions until you cross over them and fail. Agile methods are
      still too young to see enough action to get a sense of where the
      boundaries are. This is further compounded by the fact that it's
      so hard to decide what success and failure mean in software
      development, as well as too many varying factors to easily pin
      down the source of problems.</p>

<p>So where should you not use an agile method? I think it
      primarily comes down to the people. If the people involved aren't
      interested in the kind of intense collaboration that agile
      working requires, then it's going to be a big struggle to get
      them to work with it. In particular I think that this means you
      should never try to impose agile working on a team that doesn't
      want to try it.</p>

<p>There's been lots of experience with agile methods over the
      last ten years. At ThoughtWorks we always use an agile approach
      if our clients are willing, which most of the time they are. I
      (and we) continue to be big fans of this way of working.</p>
