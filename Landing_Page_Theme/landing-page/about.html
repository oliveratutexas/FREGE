							Clear thinking is required for success in all human endeavors. "Clear" is not equivalent to "formal" and none of us writes out a formal logic proof every time we need to answer an important question.  But formal logic is an important pedagogical tool in much the same way that other "exercises" are:

					<ul class="bulletsquare">
						<li>Piano students practice scales.</li>
						<li>Athletes do pushups.</li>
						<li>Thinkers (of all stripes) write small proofs in formal logic so that they understand the difference between sound and unsound reasoning.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="paragraph">
							But formal logic is more than an exercise for students. It's also a powerful practical tool in its own right.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">For example:</p>
					<ul class="bulletsquare">
						<li>Mathematicians write formal proofs, both as a way to derive insight and as a way to certify truth.</li>
						<li>Computer scientists write formal specifications for programs and applications.  Then they reason with those specifications to construct working systems.</li>
						<li>Computer engineers use logic as the basis for the design of computer circuits.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="paragraph">
							Yet, despite its importance, logic shows up barely (if at all) in most pre-college curricula today.  At one time, most high school geometry classes had a large proof-based component.  But that is no longer true.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
							So students come to college with almost no exposure to this fundamental tool.  Our goal is to create an online learning environment that fixes that problem.
